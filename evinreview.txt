A Step Further Towards a Consensus on Linking Tweets to Wikipedia

Abstract. Entity Linking (EL) is an essential task for information access and retrieval. Given a text snippet, the task is to identify mentions of entities and link them to a knowledge base (KB). Applying EL to tweets is particularly challenging due to their short, noisy nature and limited context. This paper addresses two primary limitations in tweet-based EL: (1) the lack of common annotation guidelines for defining valid mention-entity links, and (2) the absence of benchmark datasets based on such guidelines. We propose a set of rules and guidelines derived from human tacit agreements, defining valid annotations based on entity topical coherence, dominance, and mention characteristics. We introduce TELS, a new end-to-end EL system developed in light of these rules, achieving state-of-the-art results. TELS uses a Random Forest classifier fed with features that integrate entity dominance, relevance, and topical coherence. Tested on five datasets, TELS obtains an overall macro F1-score of 0.5412, outperforming all baselines by at least 25.04%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that revising datasets according to our rules improves the performance of existing EL systems.

1 Introduction

Entity Linking is fundamental for semantic enrichment of texts. State-of-the-art EL systems typically follow a pipeline approach: (1) mention detection, (2) candidate entity generation, and (3) entity disambiguation/linking. Tweets pose significant challenges due to their brevity and noisy nature, often leading to poor performance for existing systems.

The lack of consensus on the criteria for defining a valid link is a major issue. Current systems often rely on proprietary heuristics, making cross-system comparison difficult. Our objective is to formalize the tacit human agreements used during dataset annotation, particularly concerning topical entities.

Contributions:

    A set of rules and guidelines to define a valid annotation, addressing the EL task consensus.
    A new EL system, TELS, developed according to these guidelines.
    Extensive evaluation showing TELS's superior performance and the effectiveness of the proposed rules on dataset quality.

2 Related Work

Recent efforts in EL for tweets include systems leveraging temporal coherence, contextual similarity, and domain-specific knowledge. However, few address the issue of defining valid links. The work of [21] introduced a rule-based system, but we propose a more formalized and rule-based approach to capture annotators’ tacit agreements, particularly focusing on entity relevance and dominance.
3 Towards Consensus on Annotation Guidelines

Current difficulties arise from:

    Diversity of criteria used by annotators to define valid links.
    Absence of benchmark datasets based upon common annotation guidelines.

4 Rules for Proper Wikification of Tweet Contents

We propose a set of rules to identify and link mentions to Wikipedia entities.

Definition 1 (Mention). Each occurrence of a term or sequence of terms in a text represents a mention m. Defined by a pair (pm​,lm​), position and length.

Definition 2 (Entity). Excluding Wikipedia redirect and disambiguation pages, each Wikipedia page represents an entity E identified by a unique page ID.

Definition 3 (Annotation). An annotation <m,E> is the linking of a mention m, located in a tweet, to an entity E.

Definition 4 (Entity dominance). The dominance of an entity E corresponds to the extent to which E is popular and central in a given source of common knowledge.

Definition 5 (Entity relevance). The relevance of an entity E to a given mention m, located in a tweet t, is proportional to:

    topical coherence of E with the context of t
    dominance of E with respect to a recent common knowledge source

Valid Annotation Conditions: An annotation <m,E> is valid if and only if the following conditions hold:

R1. m is not a Twitter user mention (preceded by '@'). R2. E is a proper entity according to Definition 2. R3. m is the primary topic of the entity E. R4. m is the longest description of E that occurs in the tweet. R5. E is relevant according to Definition 5 (topical coherence or dominance).
4.1 Guidelines

The rules lead to four specific guidelines (G1-G4) for identifying entities and one general guideline (G5) for handling dominant entities in tweets with limited context.

G1: Only Proper Entities: Adheres to R2, excluding disambiguation and redirect pages. G2: Only Principal Topics: Adheres to R3, ensuring the mention is the main subject of the entity page. G3: Longest Mention: Adheres to R4, prioritizing the longest possible mention of an entity. G4: Coherent Entities: Adheres to R5 (topical coherence), prioritizing entities whose topic is coherent with the tweet context. G5: Dominant Entities: Adheres to R5 (dominance), annotating dominant entities if they are of a general type (e.g., Location, Event, Product) when G4 is insufficient.

Application Order: G1-G3 are applied first, followed by G4 (topical coherence), and finally G5 (dominance) for remaining entity mentions.

Example (Figure 3): Tweet1: "White House(G4) says Obama(G4) will deliver a statement on Japan(G5) in the Rose Garden(G4) at 3:30 P.M. ET" Mentions are highlighted. White House, Obama, and Rose Garden are annotated following G4 (coherence). Japan is annotated following G5 (dominant Location entity).
5 Proposed EL system (TELS)

TELS is designed to link a tweet to Wikipedia pages representing its topical entities, adhering to the proposed rules.

Architecture (Figure 4):

    Datasets creation: Inverted index and context dataset creation (R2).
    Tweet Preprocessing: Removes Twitter mentions (R1).
    Mention-entity candidates generation: Extracts n-grams and matches them to Wikipedia anchors.
    Feature extraction: Extracts features related to R3 and R5.
    Entity Extraction & Disambiguation (RF classifier): Uses a Random Forest classifier.
    Entity longest description filtering: Filters pairs to keep the longest description (R4).

Preprocessing and Candidate Generation (5.1):

    R1 is applied: Twitter user mentions (@usernames) are removed.
    Hashtags are expanded (e.g., #TheForceAwakens → "The Force Awakens").
    URLs are removed.
    Text is split into phrases to avoid extracting mentions separated by punctuation.
    N-grams (sequences of 1 to N terms) are extracted and matched to Wikipedia anchors to generate candidate pairs (n-gram, entity).

Feature Extraction (5.2): Features are structured into two subsets corresponding to R5 (Relevance: Dominance and Topical Coherence) and R3 (Primary Topic).

Features associated with R5 (Topical Coherence and Dominance) (Table 4):
Features	Description
Topical coherence features	
LE Overlap(t, E)	Overlap between tweet t and LE​ (set of references linking to E).
InCategory(n-gram, CE​)	1 if n-gram occurs in categories of E.
CE​ Overlap(n-gram, t, E)	Overlap between tweet t and CE​ (categories section).
CE​ Overlap(n-gram, t, E)	Overlap between tweet t and CE​ (anchors/titles in E's abstract).
Dominance features	
rE	Page rank of E (centrality marker).
vE	Number of visits
